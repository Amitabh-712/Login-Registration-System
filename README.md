# Login-Registration-System
My first C++ project 
In this project we ask the user if she wants to register or login.

If the user wants to register, then we ask the username and password. We create a file storing the username and password of the user.

If the user wants to login we ask for the username and password, and then check whether there is a file containing the details of the user, and dependin on that we print a message.
